    Create a counter function that performs calculations and
    updates its input value.

    This function takes a number and a function as input.
    It returns a callable object that acts as a counter function.
    Each time the counter function is called, it calculates the result of the
    provided function applied to the input number, updates the input number
    with the result, and returns the calculated result.
    Additionally, it keeps track of the number of times it's been called.

    Parameters:
    x (int | float): The initial input value.
    function (function): The function to be applied for calculations.

    Returns:
    object: A callable object (counter function) that calculates and updates the value.

        This inner function performs the following steps:
        1. Execute the provided function using the current input value.
        2. Update the input value with the result of the calculation.
        3. Increment the internal counter to keep track of the number of calls.
        4. Return the result of the calculation.
