    Truncate a 2D array based on the provided start and end arguments.

    Args:
        family (list): 2D array to be truncated.
        start (int): Index to start truncation from.
        end (int): Index to end truncation at.

    Returns:
        list: Truncated version of the array.
    My shape:
        Calculates the shape of the original family array
        using NumPy's np.array() function and then retrieves its
        shape using the .shape attribute. The shape of a 2D array is
        a tuple representing the number of rows and columns.
        This line prints the shape of the original array.
    New shape:
        Calculates the shape of the truncated array.
        It first creates a NumPy array from the family list,
        then slices it from the start index to the end+1 index.
        The .shape attribute is used to retrieve the shape of the
        truncated array, which represents the number of rows and
        columns after the truncation.
